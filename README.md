# Food Truck App - Fork Knife

A simple Google Maps based app. Essentially, the app has 4 screens, a welcome screen,
the login screen, the registration screen, and the map screen.
The main functionality of the app resides in the map screen, while the others are simple
for login and registration purposes. On the map screen, numerous map markers with custom icons
will be displayed that are interactive and display information about it's respective food truck
upon being tapped.

## Usage:
Essentially (and hopefully), all that is needed to run this app is on an Android device (it was only 
configured and designed with Android devices in mind) with the latest version of the Android OS, a
connection to the internet, and has basic location services.
## Directions:
Run this command to ensure all dependencies are there:
- $ flutter pub get
Then run this command while in the project folder:
- $ flutter run
Or simply press the 'Run' button in Android Studio or Visual Studio Code in this Flutter project.
